A community-driven graphics modification implementing **Checkerboard Rendering (CBR)** in *Red Dead Redemption 2* (PC), bringing the PlayStation 4 Pro's hardware-assisted temporal reconstruction technique to modern PC GPUs—specifically targeting the **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti** and Pascal-architecture hardware.

> **⚠️ Project Status: Prototyping & Pipeline Architecture Phase**  
> The engineering specifications, reconstruction compute shaders, configuration system, logging and unit tests are written. **The graphics hooks are not implemented yet, so the mod currently has no effect in-game** (it loads, reads `cbr.ini`, writes `cbr.log` and then waits for hooks that do not exist). The install and in-game-settings steps below describe the intended setup once game integration lands. Public release builds will follow game integration validation.

## About

On the PlayStation 4 Pro, *Red Dead Redemption 2* outputs a 4K presentation by rendering only half the pixels per frame (1920×2160 or quarter-resolution with 2× MSAA) in an alternating checkerboard pattern, reconstructing missing details across time. 

On PC, players on mid-range GPUs such as the **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti** face a difficult dilemma:
- **Native 4K (3840×2160)** is too demanding for 60 FPS gameplay on Pascal hardware.
- **DLSS** requires RTX hardware (Tensor cores) and cannot run on Pascal GPUs.
- **FSR** provides spatial/temporal upscaling but has a distinct aesthetic and does not replicate the console presentation.

This project delivers a **native ASI plugin** that intercepts RDR2's rendering passes, renders the primary geometry at half shading cost, and reconstructs a full 4K frame using an optimized compute shader with temporal reprojection, depth disocclusion detection, and YCoCg neighborhood color clamping.

## How It Works

```
Frame N:     [ X ] [   ] [ X ] [   ]  <-- Shaded at Quarter-Res 2x MSAA + Jitter
             [   ] [ X ] [   ] [ X ]
               |
               v
Reconstruct: Current Active Pixels  <─── Keep 2x MSAA Samples
             Missing Holes          <─── Sample Previous Frame (N-1) using Motion Vectors
                                         [Depth Validation & 3x3 YCoCg Clamping]
               |
               v
Output:      Full 3840×2160 4K Image
```

1. **Target Interception:** Intercepts main scene color and depth attachments, routing them to quarter-resolution (1920×1080) targets configured with 2× MSAA.
2. **Projection Jitter:** Alternates the camera projection matrix horizontally by 1 full-resolution pixel on odd frames (0 on even frames), shifting the 2× MSAA subpixel grid to achieve 100% 4-quadrant geometric coverage across two frames.
3. **MIP LOD Bias Injection:** Injects a $-0.5$ LOD bias into scene texture samplers, ensuring high-frequency textures sample at full 4K Nyquist clarity despite reduced geometry resolution.
4. **Compute Shader Reconstruction:** Runs a compute shader (`cbr_reconstruct.comp` / `cbr_reconstruct.hlsl`) that evaluates pixel parity, reprojects history using motion vectors, tests depth for disocclusion, and clamps against the 3×3 color neighborhood.

## Reconstruction Shader Math

The core compute shader resolves pixels based on parity:

$$\text{Phase}(x, y) = (x + y) \pmod 2$$

- When $\text{Phase}(x, y) = (\text{FrameIndex} \pmod 2)$, the pixel is sampled directly from the current frame's 2× MSAA buffer.
- When $\text{Phase}(x, y) \neq (\text{FrameIndex} \pmod 2)$, the pixel is reprojected from history:

$$\mathbf{UV}_{\text{prev}} = \mathbf{UV}_{\text{curr}} - \mathbf{V}(x, y)$$

If the depth variance exceeds the tolerance threshold:

$$\Delta Z = \frac{|Z_{\text{curr}} - Z_{\text{prev}}|}{\max(Z_{\text{curr}}, 10^{-5})} > \text{Threshold}$$

The shader rejects the history sample and executes a spatial cross-bilateral filter from the current frame's four orthogonal (cardinal: up, down, left, right) active samples:

$$C_{\text{spatial}} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^4 w_k C_k}{\sum_{k=1}^4 w_k}, \quad w_k = \exp\left(-\frac{\|p_k - p\|^2}{2\sigma_d^2}\right) \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{|Z_k - Z|^2}{2\sigma_z^2}\right)$$

## 🚀 How to Build, Install & Run

### Step 1: Software Prerequisites
To compile the mod from source, ensure you have:
1. **Visual Studio 2022** (Community or higher) with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload (C++20).
2. **CMake** (v3.20 or newer).
3. **Vulkan SDK** (1.3.x from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)).
4. An **ASI Loader** for RDR2 (`dinput8.dll`). Download it only from the loader project's official release page and verify its checksum before installing.

### Step 2: Build the ASI Plugin
Run the following commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShreyasP10/Checkerboard-Rendering.git
cd Checkerboard-Rendering

# Create build directory and generate Visual Studio solution
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64

# Compile the Release build
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The build process outputs:
- `build/bin/rdr2-cbr.asi` — The compiled ASI mod binary.
- `build/bin/cbr.ini` — The default configuration file.

### Step 3: Install into RDR2 from Scratch

#### 3.1 Locate Your RDR2 Installation Directory
Find the folder containing `RDR2.exe`:
- **Steam:** Right-click *Red Dead Redemption 2* in your Steam Library > **Manage** > **Browse local files** (typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Red Dead Redemption 2\`).
- **Rockstar Games Launcher:** Open Launcher > **Settings** > **My installed games** > **Red Dead Redemption 2** > **View installation folder** (typically `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\`).
- **Epic Games Store:** Open Epic Launcher > Library > Click the three dots under RDR2 > **Manage** > Click the folder icon next to *Installation* (typically `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Red Dead Redemption 2\`).

#### 3.2 Install the ASI Loader
An ASI loader is required to load custom `.asi` game modifications:
1. Download `dinput8.dll` from the official [Script Hook RDR2](https://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/) release by Alexander Blade (confirm the page loads over a valid HTTPS connection), or from an ASI loader project's official release page. Verify any published checksum before use.
2. Place `dinput8.dll` directly into the RDR2 root folder (where `RDR2.exe` is located).

#### 3.3 Deploy CBR Plugin & Configuration
Copy the built mod files into your RDR2 root directory:
1. Copy `rdr2-cbr.asi` into the RDR2 root folder.
2. Copy `cbr.ini` into the RDR2 root folder.

Your RDR2 folder structure should look like this:
```
Red Dead Redemption 2/
├── RDR2.exe                  <-- Game executable
├── dinput8.dll               <-- ASI Loader (executes .asi plugins)
├── rdr2-cbr.asi              <-- Checkerboard Rendering Mod Plugin
├── cbr.ini                   <-- Mod configuration settings
└── ... (game data files)
```

---

### Step 4: Configure `cbr.ini` Before First Launch

Open `cbr.ini` in Notepad or your preferred text editor and customize the parameters for your monitor and hardware:

```ini
[General]
Enabled = true
TargetWidth = 3840           ; Set to your display resolution width (e.g. 3840 for 4K, 2560 for 1440p)
TargetHeight = 2160          ; Set to your display resolution height (e.g. 2160 for 4K, 1440 for 1440p)
PreferredApi = Vulkan        ; "Vulkan" (strongly recommended for Pascal/GTX 1070 Ti), "D3D12", or "Auto"
MipLodBias = -0.5            ; Reserved: not applied yet (will bias scene texture sampling once the geometry pass is hooked)

[Reconstruction]
DepthTolerance = 0.010       ; Relative depth disocclusion sensitivity threshold
EnableColorClamping = true   ; Enables variance clipping to eliminate temporal ghosting
ColorSpace = YCoCg           ; YCoCg provides artifact-free color bounding box calculation
HistoryWeight = 0.90         ; 0.90 retains 90% temporal history on static pixels
EnableSpatialFallback = true ; Uses cross-bilateral filter when history is disoccluded
EnableMotionDilation = true  ; 3x3 closest-depth motion dilation over active samples
DepthConvention = Reversed   ; RDR2 reversed-Z depth (1 near .. 0 far) or Standard (0 near .. 1 far)
DepthNear = 0.1              ; Near plane in metres (used for linear depth disocclusion tests)
DepthFar = 0.0               ; Far plane in metres (0.0 = infinite far plane for Reversed)

[Jitter]
JitterPattern = Checkerboard ; 2-phase complementary grid jitter (whole-pixel horizontal shift)
JitterScale = 1.0            ; Jitter scale (1.0 = exact whole-pixel coverage shift)
JitterDirection = 1          ; Odd-frame horizontal shift direction: +1 or -1
JitterCompensation = 0.0     ; History reprojection jitter sign (default 0.0: whole-pixel shift is absorbed by sample mapping)

[Debug]
ShowOverlay = false          ; Toggle in-game overlay
DebugView = 0                ; 0=Reconstructed 4K, 1=CBR Mask, 2=Disocclusion Heatmap, 3=Motion Vectors, 4=Raw
LogToFile = true             ; Writes cbr.log for installation diagnostic
LogLevel = Info              ; Debug, Info, Warning, Error
```

### Step 5: Recommended In-Game Graphics Settings (Complete Walkthrough)

> **Note:** these are the *intended* settings for when integration lands. They have not been verified in-game, and claims about engine behavior (velocity vectors, MSAA, VRAM headroom) are working assumptions from the design, to be confirmed by reverse engineering.

Launch *Red Dead Redemption 2*, open **Settings > Graphics**, and configure the options as detailed below:

#### 1. Display & Window Settings
* **Screen Type:** Set to **Fullscreen** (Windowed/Borderless can cause DWM scaling artifacts and input latency).
* **Resolution:** Set to your target output resolution (e.g., **3840×2160** or **2560×1440**). *Must match `TargetWidth` and `TargetHeight` in `cbr.ini`.*
* **Refresh Rate:** Set to your monitor's native refresh rate (e.g. 60Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz).
* **V-Sync:** **On** (or use NVIDIA G-Sync / AMD FreeSync) to prevent presentation screen tearing.
* **Triple Buffering:** **On** (smooths frame delivery and pacing when targeting 60 FPS).

#### 2. Advanced Graphics API Setting (Critical!)
* **Unlock Advanced Settings:** Set to **Unlocked**.
* **Graphics API:** Set to **Vulkan** (the planned primary target for Pascal GP104 hardware; the expected benefit is finer control over sample positions, to be confirmed. If switching from DirectX 12 to Vulkan, restart the game).
* **Async Compute:** **On** (untested with this mod).

#### 3. Anti-Aliasing & Resolution Scaling (Critical!)
* **Resolution Scale:** Set to **Off / 1.0×** (*CRITICAL:* Never set this to 0.75×, 0.85×, etc. In-game resolution scaling breaks 1:1 subpixel checkerboard parity mapping).
* **TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing):** Set to **Medium** or **High** (*Assumption to verify:* the engine's velocity vectors (`u_Velocity`) are expected to be produced only while TAA is enabled, and CBR needs them for temporal history reprojection).
* **TAA Sharpening:** Adjust according to personal preference (typically 30%–50%).
* **FXAA:** **Off** (redundant post-processing blur).
* **MSAA:** **Off** (leave in-game MSAA disabled; the planned design has CBR allocate its own dedicated 2× MSAA intermediate buffer, which is not implemented yet).

#### 4. Geometry & Texture Settings (Optimized for GTX 1070 Ti / Pascal 8 GB)
* **Texture Quality:** **Ultra** (the CBR buffers themselves need ~315.19 MB; whether Ultra textures plus those fit in 8 GB at 4K is unverified, so lower this first if you run out of VRAM).
* **Anisotropic Filtering:** **16×** (negligible performance cost on Pascal GPUs; keeps road and terrain textures sharp at oblique viewing angles).
* **Lighting Quality:** **Medium** or **High**.
* **Global Illumination Quality:** **High**.
* **Shadow Quality:** **High**.
* **Far Shadow Quality:** **Medium** or **High**.
* **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO):** **High**.
* **Reflection Quality:** **Medium** (High/Ultra reflections are very expensive in RDR2).
* **Mirror Quality:** **High**.
* **Water Quality:** **Medium** (Custom / Water Physics: 2/4).
* **Volumetrics Quality:** **Medium** (Raymarched volumetric fog is compute-heavy at 4K; Medium provides optimal 60 FPS headroom).
* **Particle Quality:** **Medium**.
* **Tessellation Quality:** **High** (keeps tree bark and ground snow tracks detailed).
* **Motion Blur:** **Off** (recommended for cleanest checkerboard temporal stability).

---

### Step 6: Verifying Installation via Logs & Debug Modes

#### 6.1 Check Initialization Log (`cbr.log`)
Exit or Alt-Tab from the game and open `cbr.log` in the RDR2 root folder to verify that the mod was loaded:
```text
=================================================================
 RDR2 Checkerboard Rendering Mod (CBR) Log Initialized           
 Maintainer: Shreyas Pawar                                       
 Target: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 Ti & Vulkan / DX12              
=================================================================
[INFO] Initializing CBREngine for Red Dead Redemption 2...
[INFO] Configuration successfully loaded from cbr.ini (Target: 3840x2160, API: Vulkan, CBR Enabled: true)
[INFO] RenderTargetManager initialized for target: 3840x2160

[INFO] Total CBR VRAM Footprint: 315.19 MB
[WARN] Vulkan hook installation is not implemented yet; no hooks are active.
[INFO] CBREngine initialized successfully. Ready for frame interception.
```

#### 6.2 Visual Inspection with Debug Views
You can toggle diagnostic visualization modes in `cbr.ini` by modifying `DebugView`:
- `DebugView = 0`: **Normal Reconstructed Output** (standard 4K CBR presentation).
- `DebugView = 1`: **Checkerboard Subpixel Mask** — displays a 1:1 pixel mask. **White** pixels were natively shaded in the current frame; **Black** pixels were reconstructed from history.
- `DebugView = 2`: **Disocclusion Heatmap** — **Green** indicates valid temporal reprojection; **Red** highlights disoccluded geometry using spatial cross-bilateral fallback.
- `DebugView = 3`: **Motion Vector Field** — visualizes screen-space velocity vectors (R=horizontal motion, G=vertical motion).
- `DebugView = 4`: **Raw Buffer** — displays the unresolved quarter-resolution native render.

---

### Step 7: Troubleshooting & FAQ

* **Q: The game crashes immediately on startup.**
  * *A:* Verify you installed a clean, compatible `dinput8.dll` ASI loader. The plugin is built with a static CRT, so no Visual C++ redistributable is required for it. Check `cbr.log` for any error messages.
* **Q: `cbr.log` is not created at all.**
  * *A:* This means `dinput8.dll` is either missing, blocked by Windows SmartScreen/Antivirus, or located in the wrong directory. Ensure `dinput8.dll`, `rdr2-cbr.asi`, and `cbr.ini` are in the **same folder** as `RDR2.exe`.
* **Q: The game looks blurry or pixelated.**
  * *A:* Verify that **Resolution Scale** in the Graphics menu is set to **Off / 1.0×**, and that **TAA** is set to **Medium** or **High**.
* **Q: Can I use this mod in Red Dead Online?**
  * *A:* **No.** This mod is strictly designed and intended for single-player story mode. Never use modified game files or ASI loaders when connecting to Red Dead Online to avoid anti-cheat bans.

## Configuration (`cbr.ini`)

Settings are customized in `cbr.ini` before launch (live editing via the in-game overlay is planned). `PreferredApi` accepts `Vulkan`, `D3D12` or `Auto`. `JitterPattern = Halton` is reserved and currently falls back to Checkerboard with a warning.

```ini
[General]
Enabled = true
TargetWidth = 3840
TargetHeight = 2160
PreferredApi = Vulkan
MipLodBias = -0.5

[Reconstruction]
DepthTolerance = 0.010
EnableColorClamping = true
ColorSpace = YCoCg
HistoryWeight = 0.90
EnableSpatialFallback = true
EnableMotionDilation = true

[Jitter]
JitterScale = 1.0
JitterCompensation = 1.0
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-tests -DCBR_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-tests --target cbr_tests cbr_engine_tests
ctest --test-dir build-tests --output-on-failure
```

The tests cover the portable code only (no Windows APIs or GPU): config, logger, jitter, push-constant layout, and the engine's hook-retry, once-per-frame dispatch and frame-parity logic (using fake hook installers). Validate shaders with:

```bash
glslangValidator -V shaders/cbr_reconstruct.comp -o /tmp/r.spv
glslangValidator -V shaders/cbr_resolve_simple.comp -o /tmp/s.spv
glslangValidator -D -e CSMain -S comp -V shaders/cbr_reconstruct.hlsl -o /tmp/h.spv
```
